# OSO_Game
---
The game "Oso" is an engaging two-player game designed to test strategy and quick thinking on a 10x10 grid. Each player alternates turns, during which they can place either an "O" or an "S" on any empty cell of the grid. The primary goal is to strategically position the letters to form the word "OSO" in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Scoring in "Oso" occurs every time a player successfully completes the word "OSO." Each completed "OSO" formation earns the player a point, making it crucial to not only focus on creating the word but also to block the opponent's attempts. The game continues with players strategically placing their letters to maximize their points while minimizing their opponentâ€™s scoring opportunities.

In addition to the core gameplay, "Oso" features a live chat function that enhances the interactive experience. This chat allows players to communicate in real-time, whether to discuss strategies, celebrate victories, or simply enjoy casual conversation during the game. The live chat adds a social dimension to "Oso," making it more engaging and fostering a sense of community among players.

Overall, "Oso" combines strategic gameplay with real-time communication, offering a dynamic and enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both competition and collaboration.
